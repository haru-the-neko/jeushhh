    <div class="section-box">
        <h3>CHILDHOOD</h3>
        <p>I was born on November 21, 2004, in a small town in Quezon.<sup>1</sup> My home was 
            consisted of my dad, mom, and my younger siblings.<sup>2</sup> I also have three older half sisters 
            that lives in my grandparents house.<sup>3</sup> We were pretty close to each other, I remember 
            my dad was stricter than my mom, but they were always supportive of whatever we did.<sup>4</sup> 
            I grew up in a quiet rural neighborhood, it felt safe, and everyone knew each other.<sup>5</sup> We 
            lived in a two-story house with a big front yard and garage, perfect for playing with my 
            siblings.<sup>6</sup> I remember we used to dig for worms on our yard and play with it.<sup>7</sup> I didn’t have 
            a lot of friends back then since I rarely went outside.<sup>8</sup> I usually just hang with my siblings 
            and my sister’s friends which I also considered my sisters.<sup>9</sup> We would watch movies and 
            series that was on CD’s back then, spent hours playing console games, and we also play 
            pretend adventures in the woods behind our grandparents’ house, where we’d imagine 
            we were explorers on some grand quests.<sup>10</sup> And those are just few of my fav things to do 
            whenever we hung out.<sup>11</sup> I attended Jose Rizal Elementary, a small school that felt more 
            like a community than an institution.<sup>12</sup> The teachers knew everyone by name, and I always 
            felt supported there.<sup>13</sup> My favorite subject was art because I liked to draw, and just because 
            I also hated writing a lot.<sup>14</sup> I did well overall in school, I did excel in math at that time 
            because my dad made me memorize all the multiplication table from 1 to 10.<sup>15</sup> He also 
            taught me the fingers trick, if I couldn’t remember them and had a lot of addition and 
            subtraction.<sup>16</sup> My parents taught me the value of kindness, always reminding me that being 
            a good person mattered more than being the best at anything.<sup>17</sup> We also had a pet 
            Labrador named Erap, He was our constant companion, and also guards our house.<sup>18</sup> My 
            grandparents also played a huge role in my childhood. I spent summers at their house, 
            where they would tell me a lot of stories and also make meals for me.<sup>19</sup> My family also took 
            trips every vacation, my fav one was when we went to Manila Ocean Park.<sup>20</sup> It was my first 
            time seeing a penguin.<sup>21</sup> I still have a lot of things to tell, but that pretty sums up my 
            childhood. Overall, my childhood was filled with love, adventure, and lessons that have 
            stayed with me to this day.<sup>22</sup></p>

        <h3>TEENAGE</h3>
        <p>I became a teenager when I turned 13, and one of the major changes was starting 
            high school.<sup>1</sup> It felt like a whole new world compared to middle school.<sup>2</sup> I went to Sariaya 
            Institute because that’s where my parents finished high school.<sup>3</sup> It was much bigger than
            my previous school.<sup>4</sup> It was diverse, with a mix of students from a different backgrounds, 
            and I like the feeling of being part of something bigger.<sup>5</sup> I came to that school not knowing 
            anyone and without my friends from middle school.<sup>6</sup> But I did make some new friends 
            during my teenage year.<sup>7</sup> I became close with people who shared similar humor, interest 
            in music, sports and also foods, and we’d hangout every lunch break and after school, 
            especially on weekends.<sup>8</sup> I also joined the art’s club where we’re the ones who’d make 
            decorations every time that there is an event.<sup>9</sup> My relationship with my parents was 
            generally good, though we had our share of disagreements, especially about curfew and 
            freedom. But, I know that deep down, they were just worried and were always supportive 
            of my whatever I’m doing.<sup>10</sup> During my teenage years, I play a lot of video games and was 
            also really into music.<sup>11</sup> I spent a lot time listening to different genres, my favorite artist 
            and bands at that time was Frank Ocean, Steve lacy, Djo, and Men I trust.<sup>12</sup> Most of my 
            free time was spent hanging out with my friends, playing video games, or going to their 
            house to play ball.<sup>13</sup> Weekends we’re usually going out somewhere.<sup>14</sup> I had a hard time 
            balancing academics and social life that time.<sup>15</sup> I struggled a bit with time management 
            and sometimes found it very hard to stay on top of everything.<sup>16</sup> I developed a long lasting 
            friendship during high school.<sup>17</sup> Some of those people are still my close friends today, and 
            we’ve supported each other through the good and bad times.<sup>18</sup> High school is also when I 
            met my girlfriend, who is still my girlfriend to this day.<sup>19</sup> There were many places we would 
            go to hang out after school but, there was this street just beside our school that we called 
            our “tambayan” its was like our meeting place where we would talk about our plans or 
            decide where we were going.<sup>20</sup> We would usually go to the beach before sunset or at night 
            just to hang out.<sup>21</sup> I remember we would blast music, chase and catch some crabs, get 
            drunk, swim, or just talk about anything.<sup>22</sup> Those were the good times in my life.<sup>23</sup> I still 
            have a lot of things to tell, but that pretty sums up my teenage years and looking back 
            at it, it was a year were a time of growth, self-discovery, and learning how to navigate 
            the ups and downs of life, and they play a huge role in shaping who I am today.<sup>24</sup></p>

        <h3>COLLEGE</h3>
        <p>I attend University of the East Manila, and my first impression when I arrived was 
            it felt like exciting new chapter of my life.<sup>1</sup> Everything is so big and far different from high 
            school.<sup>2</sup> My home was way far from here, but I felt more excitement than fear.<sup>3</sup> Even 
            though I was used to being with my family, I quickly adapted to the freedom and 
            responsibilities of college life.<sup>4</sup> I chose to major in Information in Technology, This was 
            actually my second choice because I had complication with my first one.<sup>5</sup> But I think I’ll 
            be perfectly fine, and it will still align with what I like.<sup>6</sup> When I was I child , I was always 
            curious and passionate about how stuffs worked and the technology behind them.<sup>7</sup> I feel 
            like I’m just returning to what I really liked in the first place.<sup>8</sup> My first semester was just 
            chill, I had a good schedule.<sup>9</sup> Academically it was a bit challenging, but a managed to keep 
            up with my studies.<sup>10</sup> Socially, I met a few people, but it took some time to really feel at 
            home.<sup>11</sup> I do made some great friends which is still the friends I hang out with today.<sup>12</sup> We 
            hang out every break, whether it’s just cafe and talk or be competitive on playing pool.<sup>13</sup> 
            We also hangout on weekends.<sup>14</sup> One challenge I faced was adjusting to the workload.<sup>15</sup> The 
            amount of activities and assignments was overwhelming at first, but over time, I learned 
            to manage my time better.<sup>16</sup> Time management became key for me.<sup>17</sup> I made sure to stick 
            to a schedule for studying but also made time for socializing, which helped keep me 
            balanced.<sup>16</sup> I live at a condo along Shaw, with my sister.<sup>17</sup> At the start of my second year, 
            my goals were to improve my grades, wake up early, and eat breakfast.<sup>18</sup> My second year 
            has been a bit more challenging in terms of academics.<sup>19</sup> The courses are more specialized, 
            and I have to stay on top of things more than last year.<sup>20</sup> So far, my college experience 
            has been a mix of growth, challengers and excitement.<sup>21</sup> It’s been a time of self discovery, 
            and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead.<sup>22</sup></p>
